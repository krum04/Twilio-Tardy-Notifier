# Twilio Tardy Notifier

## Overview

This project is in its early phase. It will allow an attendance coordinator to upload the  report generated every period and easily contact parents through Twilio. The messaging system will notify parents that their child has been marked tardy/absent and allow the to select if they want a follow up call. 

## To-Do

* Finish the extract.py that will clean up the contact list csv and make it useable

* Build the main script that will talk with Twilio

* Make a front end in Tkinter that is user friendly for the attendance coordinator
